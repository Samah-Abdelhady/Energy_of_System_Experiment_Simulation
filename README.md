# Energy_of_System_Experiment_Simulation
## What is it about?
### This experiment shows asimulation for calculating energy of a system. As it is a phsicsexperiment. Where we want to calculate potential,kinetic and total energies of a system overthe time.
## This repo a demo which shows the output of the simulation.
## To create this simulation I use:
1. Unity
2. C#
